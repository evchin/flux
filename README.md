# Flux

## About

In September 2020, I was selected as one of eight students across the United States to work in BitCamp Serverless. After working with Microsoft engineers to learn about serverless architecture design and development, I created Flux.

**Problem:** Fluctuations in renewable energy risk access to power, and causes us to use dirtier electricity.

**Solution:** Flux aims to reduce a user's carbon footprint and mitigate fluctuations in demand by periodically informing them of their regional power grid's demand through SMS text messaging.

See a demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e782dEDRA38).


**Important Note:** This repository does not contain the code of the actual Azure Function that powers the Flux service. This is only the React-powered frontend that receives a user's information and stores it into Azure's Cosmos DataBases.

## Instructions
1. Download this repository onto your local machine. 
2. Navigate to the folder in your computer's terminal.
3. Run the following command: ```npm start```.
4. You should now be able to see Flux's frontend website being run locally now.

*Note: In case this doesn't work, try installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and using their cmd prompt instead.*

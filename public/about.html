            <p>In 2016 and 2017, more than half of the electricity generation capacity added to the U.S. power grid
                came from renewable resources. While notably reducing our carbon footprint, fluctuations of weather 
                have brought more uncertainty in access to power.</p><br>
            <p>At noon, the sun is high and solar power is at its peak. Yet, power demand typically increases later in the 
                evening, when the sky is dark and families return home. Thus, an overgeneration of electricity is created 
                during lower demand hours. This can increase the electrical frequency, risking a disconnect between the 
                power plant and the grid. Meanwhile, high demand threatens to drop the electrical frequency, potentially 
                causing the grid to collapse.</p><br>
            <p>Flux aims to inform the user of the best times to turn power on or off. When there is low power demand, 
                Flux will text the user that it is an optimal time to use electricity if necessary. When there is high demand, 
                Flux will recommend avoiding power use. By periodically informing the user of the grid state, Flux can reduce 
                a user's carbon footprint through small changes stacking up over time.</p><br>
